# Beauty Time

## Overview

Beauty Time is an elegant and intuitive React Native application, specifically designed for a leading esthetician practice, "Beauty and the Brow". The application's primary aim is to streamline multi-step timing procedures inherent in beauty services such as lash and brow treatments, enhancing both quality and efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

### Dual-Timer Functionality

The application introduces a highly practical dual-timer feature that enables estheticians to manage different treatments independently and simultaneously. This feature is instrumental in significantly improving time efficiency and enhancing customer interaction especially when dealing with dual-sided procedures that require multiple timed steps.

### User-Friendly Interface

Beauty Time boasts an easy-to-navigate and intuitive user interface. This allows estheticians to quickly set, monitor, and adjust timings as required for each procedure, improving overall workflow and efficiency.

### Note-Taking Feature

The application features a straightforward and convenient note-taking system. This system allows estheticians to jot down important details during treatments, which significantly reduces the chances of human error and improves treatment precision and recall.

### Data Synchronization

The application integrates real-time data synchronization via Firebase. This feature enables estheticians to keep their notes and timings updated across multiple devices, facilitating a seamless workflow irrespective of their device preference.

### Product-Time Database

Beauty Time comes with a robust, searchable database that stores distinct time requirements for various products. This database aids estheticians in adhering to product-specific instructions and achieving optimal results for their clients.

## Collaborative Working

Throughout the project, we actively engaged with the founder of "Beauty and the Brow", accommodating her specifications and preferences into the application design. This close collaboration ensured that the end product perfectly matched the needs and expectations of its primary users.
